# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The 'Totals Carried Forward' at the bottom right of the page represents the cumulative totals for Day Dual, Day Pilot, Night Dual, and Night Pilot, respectively, that are carried to the next page. This is distinct from the 'TOTALS PREVIOUS' section which is based on the 'Totals Brought Forward' line on *this* page and the value written at the top of the Day Pilot column (424.45).
- TO REVIEWER: There is a discrepancy between the 'GRAND TOTAL' (557.30) and the 'Total All Types' (558.00 Day + 14.30 Night = 572.30) in the summary box. The explicit 'GRAND TOTAL' has been used.
