# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Month Year" for DATE is inferred from the note about the logbook being stolen on Jan 4, 1944, as there are no actual flight entries on this page.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS PREVIOUS" are marked as None because the "Totals Brought Forward" row at the top of the page is completely empty. The listed flying times under the note are not explicitly 'brought forward' totals, but rather an approximation of past flying times due to the logbook being stolen.
- TO REVIEWER: The detailed "Totals Carried Forward" for specific flight categories are placed under "OTHER" as the template does not provide dedicated fields for these sub-totals, apart from the single "GRAND TOTAL".
