# NOTES
- Bottom left page, near log table: May 30 1944 Sgt. Glen. Posted from 84 G.S.U (R.A.F Acton Down) to 313 Squadron in 2 Tactical Air Force. I'd lost my pilot's wings for 30 months – and arrived on a Great Spitfire Squadron at a temporary airfield at Appledram – South of Chichester, near Selsey Bill. We were under canvas. It was just a week before the invasion.
