# NOTES
- Right page, next to April 16th entry: What a spectacle! Heligoland is a tiny island Fortress in North Sea - and to see it receive everything Bomber Command could dump on it.
- Right page, next to April 19th entry: With the War in Europe obviously about to end I volunteered for the Far East. Incredibly my application was turned down as I had not given any reason! They wrote that while there were many tens of thousand British & allied prisoners of war still in Japanese hands I would consider it a disgrace to stay in England.

# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The signature below the table on the left (F/LT O.C. B. Flight) is hard to decipher, looks like "S.B. Truba" but could be "S.B. Tsuba".
- TO REVIEWER: The signature below the table on the right (S/LDR O.C. 313 Sqdn.) is largely illegible; I've transcribed it as "[illegible]" but it's very uncertain.
