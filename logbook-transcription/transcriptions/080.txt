# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Date" section for the page is listed as "October 1945" as it's the first month, but the logbook entries span both October and November 1945.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS MONTH" is calculated as the sum of all flight entries on this page (for both October and November).
- TO REVIEWER: There is a "Summary for October" block with pilot totals (13.25 single-engine, 14.30 multi-engine) that do not match the sum of the *visible* October entries on this page (5.40 single-engine, 0.00 multi-engine). This indicates either partial October entries on this page or different accounting.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Totals Brought Forward" Day Pilot (649.50) + "TOTALS MONTH" Day Pilot (42.55) = 692.05, which does not match the "GRAND TOTAL" (664.55). The "GRAND TOTAL" appears to be an overall cumulative total, not a simple sum of the current page's activity added to the previous page's totals.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Totals Carried Forward" for Single Engine Day Pilot (549.45) correctly reflects the "Totals Brought Forward" (529.00) plus the single-engine day pilot time from this page's entries (20.45). However, there is no explicit Multi-Engine Day Pilot "Totals Carried Forward" at the bottom of the page; instead, there's a "Passenger" total of 148.00.
