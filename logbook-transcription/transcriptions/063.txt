# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: I have transcribed "Fir Test" as written, despite the common error note suggesting it should be "Air Test", because the primary instruction is to transcribe exactly as written and not correct spelling/grammar.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS MONTH" for Night Pilot is written as "-40". I have transcribed it as ".40", interpreting the dash as a separator for minutes and the leading dash as implying no full hours.
