# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Pilot" column in the LOGBOOK ENTRIES table is transcribed as "self" or ditto ("") for all entries relating to the logbook owner, including a passenger flight on May 17th, to adhere to the instruction "Pilot will be "self" or ditto mark for all flights, transcribe as such."
- TO REVIEWER: For the passenger flight on May 17th, the "Time" column in the LOGBOOK ENTRIES table is left blank because the template's single "Time" column is interpreted to represent pilot time, and passenger time is not pilot time. A note has been added to the NOTES section to clarify this passenger flight.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Aircraft Type" column for May 23rd entries show ditto marks in the original log, indicating "Spitfire IX". I have used " for these entries.
- TO REVIEWER: The "No." column for May 23rd, 28th, and 29th entries shows ditto marks in the original log. I have used " for these entries. The last entry for May 29th (Scramble 1.15) refers to the last aircraft "No." which is W from May 28th.
- TO REVIEWER: "AAC Muster" is a transcription of what appears to be "AAC Muste" or "AAC Musters". I've used "AAC Muster".
- TO REVIEWER: "Mruca" is transcribed as written, although it might be an illegible signature like Mrázek.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS MONTH" Day Pilot value is calculated from the "SUMMARY FOR May 1945" box, adding "313 Squadron Day Pilot" and "Auster Day Pilot". The "TOTAL THIS PAGE" value of 13-35 confirms this sum.
