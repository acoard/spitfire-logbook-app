# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: There is a discrepancy between the sum of the logbook entries' Pilot times for the month (26.55 hours) and the "TOTALS MONTH - Day Pilot" value taken from the handwritten summary box (24.75 hours).
- TO REVIEWER: There is also a discrepancy between `TOTALS PREVIOUS (Day Pilot) + TOTALS MONTH (Day Pilot)` (226.30 + 24.75 = 251.05) and the "Totals Carried Forward" value for Day Pilot (251.45) found at the bottom of the page. The "Totals Carried Forward" appears to be the most accurate cumulative value.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Aircraft Type" in the summary box lists "Spitfire I & V", but only "Spitfire I" appears in the logbook entries. The summary box entry has been transcribed as written.
