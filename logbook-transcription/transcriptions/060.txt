# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: There is a discrepancy between the calculated total Day Pilot time from individual log entries (24.65) and the explicitly summarized Day Pilot total (24.75) for the month in the 'Summary for I TEU Tealing' section. I have used the explicit summary total (24.75) as it is directly stated on the page for "Totals Month".
- TO REVIEWER: There is a discrepancy between the sum of the "Totals Carried Forward" values (90.20 + 251.45 + 9.50 + 4.40 = 355.55) and the explicitly written "GRAND TOTAL [Cols. (1) to (10)] 356 Hrs. 25 Mins" (356.25). I have transcribed the explicitly written "GRAND TOTAL" as instructed.
- TO REVIEWER: The April 10th entry's duty "& Air/Ground Firing" appears to be a continuation or clarification of the April 5th "Bombing" duty, but it's listed as a separate entry on a different date. I have transcribed it as written.
- TO REVIEWER: The time entry for March 29th is "-.45". I have transcribed this exactly as written.
