# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: "Fir Test" was corrected to "Air Test" based on common transcription errors.
- TO REVIEWER: The pilot signature was transcribed as "R.A. Glen" based on common transcription errors.
- TO REVIEWER: The duty for the January 21st flight appears to be just a dot ".". Transcribed as such.
- TO REVIEWER: The Grand Total is transcribed as "503.45" based on the "Hrs. Mins." formatting. Note that the sum of the "Totals Carried Forward" (90.20 + 397.15 + 9.50 + 6.20 = 503.05) is inconsistent with this "503.45". This is a common logbook discrepancy.
- TO REVIEWER: There is a handwritten entry of ".55" below the last flight time of "1.15" in the Day Pilot column, without an associated date or duty. It was not included in the LOGBOOK ENTRIES as it appears incomplete.
