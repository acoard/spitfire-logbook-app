# NOTES
- Top right page: At this time the Squadron had moved from the Orkneys to R.A.F. Station North Weald - north east of London.
- Left column, below year/month: When the squadron left the Orkneys for N. Weald one Spitfire was u/s - and I was left behind to follow on in the Auster. The C.O. at Skeabrea and our Squadron were at Lossiemouth - and I recall the particular sight as our Squadron took off & circled for the last time. 10 tons of twisted metal tissues - the R.A.F's best "dump" came fluttering down - Two or three days later I flew the long way from the South of Britain to rejoin the Squadron - I can't think we had not recorded operations here - since it was not operational. Some pilots did not record operational flights - so that they could stay longer in the Squadron!
- Middle right page, below logbook entries: With vivid recollections of embarkation & a drive back, at Huthra when going to coming back from Bardufoss - I knew the Target area more often. And I recall the C/O's voice on R/T. clear & loud that was a prior experience was particularly spectacular.

# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: There is a discrepancy in the Night Pilot totals for the month. The logbook entries show red numbers "26" and "27" in the Night Pilot column for two flights. However, the "Totals Brought Forward" and "Totals Carried Forward" for Night Pilot are both 6.20, indicating no night pilot time was added this month. I have transcribed "0.00" for "Night Pilot" in "TOTALS MONTH" based on the carried forward totals remaining unchanged.
- TO REVIEWER: The note in the left column has a phrase "I can't think we had not recorded operations". It's transcribed as written, but grammatically it might have intended "I can't think why we had no recorded operations".
