# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS MONTH" for Day Pilot (40.60) has been calculated by summing the relevant "Pilot" time columns on this page. This calculated total does not align with the differences between "Totals Carried Forward" and "Totals Brought Forward" values on the logbook page, which suggests the running totals incorporate data from beyond the entries visible on this page.
- TO REVIEWER: Passenger times are noted in the "NOTES" section for entries where both pilot and passenger times were recorded, as the template has a single 'Time' column which was prioritized for pilot time.
