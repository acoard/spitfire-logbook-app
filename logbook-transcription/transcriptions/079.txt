# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: Several entries have inconsistencies between the aircraft type and the column where time is logged (e.g., Dakota in Single-Engine Day Pilot column). These have been transcribed exactly as written.
- TO REVIEWER: Some multi-engine duties and times listed on the right side of the page do not have corresponding dates or aircraft types on the left. These have been included in the NOTES section.
- TO REVIEWER: The time "6-20" for September is a total listed under the "Dual" column (1) with a note, not an individual flight entry, so "None" is entered for Sept 23's flight time.
