# NOTES
- Right page, top of remarks column: An underlining in RED indicates an operational flight - a mission where action with the enemy was possible.
- Right page, mid-top of remarks column: This "Convoy" was in Part-the Invasion Fleet.
- Left page, next to logbook entry for June 5: 30 mths elapsed from the time I got my pilots "wings" to getting to a squadron - and what could be a more dramatic way of starting on ops' than to fly daily over the tiny beach head where the Allies struggled to get ashore and open up the second front.
- Right page, mid of remarks column: Memorably provided the briefers for the invasion on D Day.
- Right page, mid-bottom of remarks column: At our very detailed and comprehensive "briefing" on the morning before the invasion - we were told that the outcome of the war required the armies to get safely ashore at all costs - and (as far as the 2nd Tactical Air Force was concerned) there were enough pilots and aircraft - in close reserve for all squadrons to suffer 90% casualties on the first day - and they'd be fully up to strength and operational pilots and planes on Day 2.
- Left page, next to logbook entry for June 13: Air Test
- Right page, bottom of remarks column: Attack on V.1 Rocket launching site - with 500 lb bomb. (Spitfire Mk IX was capable of carrying a 1000 lb bomb)
