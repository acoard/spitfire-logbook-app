# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The transcription of "GRAND TOTAL" as "602 Hrs. 95 Mins." directly follows the instruction "Do NOT modify what's written". However, the instruction "Use decimal points instead of dashes when transcribing (e.g. 1.15 not 1:15 or 1-15)" might imply conversion to a decimal hour format even from "Hrs. Mins.". Please clarify which interpretation is preferred.
- TO REVIEWER: The note for July 12th contains "1 min. 60". It's transcribed as written, but if it is actually a duration, it would be unconventional.
