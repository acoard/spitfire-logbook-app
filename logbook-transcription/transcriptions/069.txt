# NOTES
- Right side of logbook table, opposite logbook entries: My mission was to fly over Brussels at 15000' to relay radio messages from Wing Commander. I passed on a message to abort the operational mission on account of rapid deteriorating weather and though we were No 3 Squadron for home to [illegible]-be for awhile to base. The weather was too bad for bombers and fighters, mission was for Germany. Of the 37 Spitfires in our wing, I was one of only two who made it across the sea back to Olfad. I made it to Bradwell Bay. Flight Commander actually got back to N. World.
- Bottom right of page, below summary box: I think the squadron moved to Bradwell Bay in mid-December. After the luxury and sophistication of our base, Bradwell Bay certainly didn't live up to North Weald. If we had to rely on a small country house, [illegible] a bitterly cold winter and no fuel for the fire. We were billeted in a light to find a warm fire in a shared bedroom. My fellow officers were [illegible] on a chart of Stowe.
