# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The "Airport" field lists only "Skeabrae Orkneys", as it's at the very top. However, Sumburgh Shetlands is also mentioned as a base for a block of flights. The template only allows one airport name.
