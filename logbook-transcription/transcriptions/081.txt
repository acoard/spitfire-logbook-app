# HUMAN COMMENTS
- This document has not been reviewed by a human yet. Update this section after reviewing the transcription.
- TO REVIEWER: The page contains summaries for two months (November and December) and individual flight entries for December. The "DATE" field reflects the month of primary entries.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS PREVIOUS" section only includes "Day Pilot" as it's the only one of the template categories with a value from "Totals Brought Forward". Other "Totals Brought Forward" values (e.g., Passenger time) are noted in "OTHER".
- TO REVIEWER: For December 4th, an aircraft of type 'Dakota' (multi-engine) has its time recorded under the 'Single-Engine Day Pilot' column.
- TO REVIEWER: For December 5th, 7th, 16th, and 31st, "self" is listed as the pilot in the logbook's "Pilot or 1st Pilot" column, but time is recorded in the 'Passenger' column. These flights are transcribed with 0.00 time in the "Time" column, and the remarks are noted under 'NOTES'.
- TO REVIEWER: The "TOTALS MONTH" value (8.45 Day Pilot) is taken from the "Summary for December" line, which does not appear to be a direct sum of the individual pilot flight entries listed on this page for December (which sum to 23.10).
